excerpt: "Where did this magical place come from?"

Building 20 was a temporary building at MIT. A magical place, [most dispassionate
souls would argue][1]. Sadly, it had to be taken down. But 4 gentlemen decided
it had a spirit that deserved to continue, and so brought it with them into a
new home.
